# Daily-Journal

A dynamic local website (a blog or daily journal site) that allows the publisher to create new posts that get added to its homepage where other people can read them by clicking on a link next to it, which redirects to a new webpage that contains the full content of that post.

The website was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, while Nodejs/Express was used for the back-end. 

What made this website/server 'dynamic' was through the extensive use of EJS templating. 

The Hyper command line was used to install modules/dependencies (i.e. JSON package) via npm install etc. To run the app, Nodemon was run in the cli ("Nodemon app.js") and by opening up a browser and typing in "localhost:3000/" in the address bar. 

Lastly, Lodash was installed and used in code for dealing with javascript strings and route naming.
